Only scumbug journalists still argue on the basis of two-dose efficacy data.",
"Also Zhihu article is misleading AF: yes Sinovac's protection only approximates that of mRNA after 3rd shot, but even 2-shot regimen helps to materially lower death rate. China also has few other domestic vaccines in use that are better than Sinovac, and a higher overall vaxxed %",

"This is also the age group with much poorer vaccination compared to New York. We can see that across all ages vaccination rates are higher in NY, and especially in higher age groups. The problem here isn't that Sinovac doesn't work, but that elderly people aren't vaxxed. https://t.co/nLCWEmwJrY",
